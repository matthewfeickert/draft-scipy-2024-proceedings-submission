## Copy over from proposal edit this

The [ATLAS experiment at CERN](https://atlas.cern/), in Geneva, Switzerland, studies subatomic particles to seek answers to the most fundamental questions of the Universe.
Due to the rarity of interesting subatomic phenomena, vast amounts of data are collected by the experiment.
Those data are further reduced but physicists still have to analyze hundreds of terabytes for their studies.
This has been traditionally conducted using experiment-specific custom C++ frameworks.

In recent years, there has been a broad community-driven shift towards the Scientific Python ecosystem inside of particle physics.
The use of dataframes and NumPy-like idioms for data analysis has enhanced the user experience while providing efficient computations without the need of coding optimized low-level routines.
This trend is followed by the education system too, as students learn python as the primary programming language.
Therefore, the ATLAS collaboration committed to extend and improve its data analysis paradigm by leveraging the Scientific Python ecosystem and its benefits.
Open-source libraries have been used to build domain-specific data analytics and visualization workflows.
Those libraries belong either to the general Scientific Python ecosystem or to the particle physics-specific [Scikit-HEP](https://scikit-hep.org/) ecosystem.
Furthermore, next generation C++/Python binding tools have been used to expose pieces of the legacy C++ code, which encapsulates decades of domain-specific development, to the Python environment.

The talk will briefly introduce the big data science conducted at CERN along with the commensurate amount of data produced and waiting for analysis.
The main objective of the talk will be to showcase how libraries from the Scientific Python ecosystem have been used to solve a common particle physics problem.
This problem is the discrimination of a signal of interest in immersive noise. Successfully tackling such a problem, the physicists of the ATLAS collaboration discovered the Higgs boson in 2012.
We will use as an example a simplified version of the data analysis workflow used for the Higgs boson discovery.
This example is selected because it contains all the usual steps a particle physics data analyst has to undertake to discriminate such a signal; data cleaning and selection, feature engineering, visualization and basic statistical interpretation.

In a Jupyter notebook, first, we will show how to load particle physics data in Python using the library [uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot5).
Using the library [awkward](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward), the data will be cleaned to remove defects and only relevant data will be selected for further analysis.
Afterwards, some required corrections will be computed and applied to the data.
Those corrections are computed by specialized custom C++ libraries, which have been exposed to Python using [nanobind](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind).
The main quantity that the Higgs boson manifests itself on the data, the so-called invariant mass, will be computed and plotted in a histogram using [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy).
[Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) will be used to visualize the histogram and numpy to extract some basic statistical measures.
The whole workflow will be horizontally scaled using [dask](https://github.com/dask/dask) and especially using the native native dask collection for awkward arrays, [dask-awkward](https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-awkward).
We will demonstrate how dask scaling greatly reduces the time to insight.
With this contribution the audience will have the chance to hear a story of how the open-source Scientific Python ecosystem is helping one of the largest international scientific collaborations in history to address its domain-specific problems and advance our understanding of the Universe.
The talk is targeting a wide spectrum of scientists, with no prior knowledge in particle physics, who analyze large amounts of domain-specific data.
It serves as a demonstration that solutions based on the Scientific Python ecosystem can well tackle problems that thus far had been addressed by specialized software without compromise on performance.
Furthermore, library developers will have the chance to see how their products are being utilized for real scientific applications at scale.

## Introduction

Twelve hundred years ago — in a galaxy just across the hill...

This document should be rendered with MyST Markdown [mystmd.org](https://mystmd.org),
which is a markdown variant inspired by reStructuredText. This uses the `mystmd`
CLI for scientific writing which can be [downloaded here](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart).
When you have installed `mystmd`, run `myst start` in this folder and
follow the link for a live preview, any changes to this file will be
reflected immediately.

## Bibliographies, citations and block quotes

Bibliography files and DOIs are automatically included and picked up by `mystmd`.
These can be added using pandoc-style citations `[@doi:10.1109/MCSE.2007.55]`
which fetches the citation information automatically and creates: [@doi:10.1109/MCSE.2007.55].
Additionally, you can use any key in the BibTeX file using `[@citation-key]`,
as in [@hume48] (which literally is `[@hume48]` in accordance with
the `hume48` cite-key in the associated `mybib.bib` file).
Read more about [citations in the MyST documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/citations).

If you wish to have a block quote, you can just indent the text, as in:

> When it is asked, What is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact? the proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked, What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation? it may be replied in one word, experience. But if we still carry on our sifting humor, and ask, What is the foundation of all conclusions from experience? this implies a new question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication.

> -- @hume48

Other typography information can be found in the [MyST documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/typography).

### DOIs in bibliographies

In order to include a DOI in your bibliography, add the DOI to your bibliography
entry as a string. For example:

```{code-block} bibtex
:emphasize-lines: 7
:linenos:
@book{hume48,
  author    =  "David Hume",
  year      = {1748},
  title     = "An enquiry concerning human understanding",
  address   = "Indianapolis, IN",
  publisher = "Hackett",
  doi       = "10.1017/CBO9780511808432",
}
```

### Citing software and websites

Any paper relying on open-source software would surely want to include citations.
Often you can find a citation in BibTeX format via a web search.
Authors of software packages may even publish guidelines on how to cite their work.

For convenience, citations to common packages such as
Jupyter [@jupyter],
Matplotlib [@matplotlib],
NumPy [@numpy],
pandas [@pandas1; @pandas2],
scikit-learn [@sklearn1; @sklearn2], and
SciPy [@scipy]
are included in this paper's `.bib` file.

In this paper we not only terraform a desert using the package terradesert [@terradesert], we also catch a sandworm with it.
To cite a website, the following BibTeX format plus any additional tags necessary for specifying the referenced content is recommended.
If you are citing a team, ensure that the author name is wrapped in additional braces `{Team Name}`, so it is not treated as an author's first and last names.

```{code-block} bibtex
:emphasize-lines: 2
:linenos:
@misc{terradesert,
  author = {{TerraDesert Team}},
  title  = {Code for terraforming a desert},
  year   = {2000},
  url    = {https://terradesert.com/code/},
  note   = {Accessed 1 Jan. 2000}
}
```

## Source code examples

No paper would be complete without some source code.
Code highlighting is completed if the name is given:

```python
def sum(a, b):
    """Sum two numbers."""

    return a + b
```

Use the `{code-block}` directive if you are getting fancy with line numbers or emphasis. For example, line-numbers in `C` looks like:

```{code-block} c
:linenos: true

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        /* do something */
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Or a snippet from the above code, starting at the correct line number, and emphasizing a line:

```{code-block} c
:linenos: true
:lineno-start: 2
:emphasize-lines: 3
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        /* do something */
    }
```

You can read more about code formatting in the [MyST documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/code).

## Figures, Equations and Tables

It is well known that Spice grows on the planet Dune [@Atr03].
Test some maths, for example $e^{\pi i} + 3 \delta$.
Or maybe an equation on a separate line:

```{math}
g(x) = \int_0^\infty f(x) dx
```

or on multiple, aligned lines:

```{math}
\begin{aligned}
g(x) &= \int_0^\infty f(x) dx \\
     &= \ldots
\end{aligned}
```

The area of a circle and volume of a sphere are given as

```{math}
:label: circarea

A(r) = \pi r^2.
```

```{math}
:label: spherevol

V(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
```

We can then refer back to Equation {ref}`circarea` or
{ref}`spherevol` later.
The `{ref}` role is another way to cross-reference in your document, which may be familiar to users of Sphinx.

:::{figure} figures/figure1.png
:label: fig:stream
This is the caption, sandworm vorticity based on storm location in a pleasing stream plot. Based on example in [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/arrays/streamplot.html).

:label: fig:em
This is the caption, electromagnetic signature of the sandworm based on remote sensing techniques. Based on example in [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/stats/hist2d.html).
:::

As you can see in @fig:stream and @fig:em, this is how you reference auto-numbered figures.
To refer to a sub figure use the syntax `@label [a]` in text or `[@label a]` for a parenhetical citation (i.e. @fig:stream [a] vs [@fig:stream a]).
For even more control, you can simply link to figures using `[Figure %s](#label)`, the `%s` will get filled in with the number, for example [Figure %s](#fig:stream).
See complete documentation on [cross-references](https://mystmd.org/guide/cross-references).

```{list-table} This is the caption for the materials table.
:label: tbl:materials
:header-rows: 1
* - Material
  - Units

* - Cement
  - {math}`\alpha`
```

We show the different quantities of materials required in
@tbl:materials.

Unfortunately, markdown can be difficult for defining tables, so if your table is more complex you can try embedding HTML:

:::{table} Area Comparisons (written in html)
:label: tbl:areas-html

<table>
<tr><th rowspan="2">Projection</th><th colspan="3" align="center">Area in square miles</th></tr>
<tr><th align="right">Large Horizontal Area</th><th align="right">Large Vertical Area</th><th align="right">Smaller Square Area<th></tr>
<tr><td>Albers Equal Area   </td><td align="right"> 7,498.7   </td><td align="right"> 10,847.3  </td><td align="right">35.8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Web Mercator        </td><td align="right"> 13,410.0  </td><td align="right"> 18,271.4  </td><td align="right">63.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Difference          </td><td align="right"> 5,911.3   </td><td align="right"> 7,424.1   </td><td align="right">27.2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Percent Difference  </td><td align="right"> 44%       </td><td align="right"> 41%       </td><td align="right">43%</td></tr>
</table>
:::

or if you prefer LaTeX you can try `tabular` or `longtable` environments:

```{raw} latex
\begin{table*}
  \begin{longtable*}{|l|r|r|r|}
  \hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{\bf Projection} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{\bf Area in square miles} \\
  \cline{2-4}
   & \textbf{Large Horizontal Area} & \textbf{Large Vertical Area} & \textbf{Smaller Square Area} \\
  \hline
  Albers Equal Area   & 7,498.7   & 10,847.3  & 35.8  \\
  Web Mercator        & 13,410.0  & 18,271.4  & 63.0  \\
  Difference          & 5,911.3   & 7,424.1   & 27.2  \\
  Percent Difference  & 44\%      & 41\%      & 43\%  \\
  \hline
  \end{longtable*}

  \caption{Area Comparisons (written in LaTeX) \label{tbl:areas-tex}}
\end{table*}
```

Perhaps we want to end off with a quote by Lao Tse[^footnote-3]:
