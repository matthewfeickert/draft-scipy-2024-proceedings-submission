## Employing the Scientific Python ecosystem

_Here we can talk about how we used to do the event-loop analysis but we're shifting towards array programming models Ã  la `numpy`.
We can describe our highly structured but jagged data and how domain specific languages, such and `awkward` (as a generalization of `numpy`) helps us deal with those peculiarities.
Maybe here we can also advertise the [Scikit-HEP](https://scikit-hep.org/) ecosystem._
